# Homelab Automation Roadmap
# Homelab Automation Roadmap

Back in **March**, I kicked off this journey with *[Building My Own GitLab]([#](https://www.simon-brooks.co.uk/2025/03/14/Building-GitLab.html))* — setting up version control to bring structure to years of scattered configs, scripts, and lab experiments.  

By **May**, I’d expanded that foundation into a full observability stack, and multi-node Docker environment — detailed in *[AI, Networking, Automation — My Ongoing Lab Project](https://www.simon-brooks.co.uk/2025/05/15/Home-Lab-Project.html)*.

Now, in **October**, the project has a structured roadmap, covering the areas I've been working on these past 7 months, and using gitlab to manage all the work i'm doing via Milestones and Issues.

## Homelab Automation Roadmap

A structured overview of my homelab evolution — from observability to AI and security integration.

### **Key Stages**
1. **Observability** – Monitor and visualise all systems.  
2. **Alerting** – Notify and escalate intelligently.  
3. **High Availability** – Build redundancy and resilience.  
4. **Ops Management** – Centralise and automate operational tasks.  
5. **NetBox** – Define and track the source of truth.  
6. **Automation** – Achieve reproducible, versioned infrastructure.  
7. **Backup** – Protect data and ensure recovery.  
8. **NGINX** – Manage ingress, SSL, and load balancing.  
9. **AI** – Extend capabilities with intelligent local systems.  
10. **Security** – Harden the stack and integrate identity management.
