## About Simon
After 7+ years in delivery and architecture roles, I’ve taken deliberate time out to reset, refocus, and rebuild.

This phase includes:
• Deep dive into automation, AI, and network design
• Home lab projects using NetBox, Grafana, and Ansible
• Technical writing and long-term career reorientation

Open to short-term contracts, architecture builds, or sharp collaborations aligned with this next cycle.
