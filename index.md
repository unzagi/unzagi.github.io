## About Simon

With over **7 years in network architecture and technical delivery** — and more than **15 years in IT overall** — I’ve taken a focused career break in **2025** to deepen my expertise in **observability, automation, systems, security, and DevOps infrastructure design**.

This current phase of my work explores:

- **Building fully redundant observability stacks** with Grafana, Prometheus, and InfluxDB.  
- **Leveraging NetBox, CI/CD, and Ansible** as the backbone for automation and source-of-truth workflows.  
- **Experimenting with AI-driven orchestration** within a self-hosted environment using n8n.  
- **Researching system hardening and identity management**, including OPNsense firewalls, OAuth, and ELK-based log analytics.

I’m open to **network engineering roles**, **observability design projects**, and **collaborations** that align with this next cycle of intelligent, automated infrastructure.
